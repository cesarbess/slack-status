# slack-status

**slack-status** updates your status across multiple teams.

## Usage

To use slack-status, you must first obtain personal tokens for each of your
teams. Those tokens can be acquired in the [Legacy Tokens](https://api.slack.com/custom-integrations/legacy-tokens)
section of the Slack API website.

After obtaning token for your teams, create a new `~/.slack-status` file with
the following contents:

```yaml
token:
  Team-Name: 'xoxp-your-very-secret-slack-token'

default: ':wave: Hello!'
```

The structure above is the minimum required to use `slack-status`. Please do
notice that:

1. `Team-Name` don't need to be the actual name of your Slack team. It is just
used to identify a team among others, since the tool supports more than one
team.
2. The `default` key is special. The tool will use this key in case no key is
provided.
3. Status keys may contain an Array. In this case, the tool will randomly pick a
status and set it.
4. The `:emoji-name: text` format is required. Although you must always provide
an `:emoji:`, the `text` part is optional.
5. Always wrap the `:emoji: text` within quotes or double-quotes.

For the following examples, assume the following configuration:

```yaml
token:
  Team-Name: 'xoxp-your-very-secret-slack-token'

default: ':wave: Hello!'
lunch:
    - ':hamburger: Lunch time!'
    - ':hamburger: Lunching'
    - ':hamburger: BRB! Lunching!'
```

### Setting the default state
If `slack-status` is invoked without arguments, it will look-up for the
`default` group and set it:

```
$ slack-status
Set on Team-Name: (wave) Hello!

$
```

### Setting a status from a named group
```bash
$ slack-status lunch
Set on Team-Name: (hamburguer) Lunching!

$ slack-status lunch
Set on Team-Name: (hamburguer) Lunch time!
```

### Unsetting your status on all teams
```bash
$ slack-status unset
Cleared your status on Team-Name.
```

### Listing available statuses
```bash
$ slack-status list
default: (wave) Hello!

lunch
  - (hamburger) Lunch time!
  - (hamburger) Lunching
  - (hamburger) BRB! Lunching!
```
